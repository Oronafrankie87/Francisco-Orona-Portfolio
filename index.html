      <h2> My name is Francisco Orona, and I am a skilled software developer from El Paso, Texas. I have a passion for
        coding and music, and I have over two
        years of experience in web development gaining knowledge on my own.

        One of my unique strengths is my diverse background. Before I pursued a career in tech, I worked as a Pharmacy
        technician, and I was also a successful studio and touring musician. These experiences have given me a creative
        edge in my work as a
        developer, and I approach each project with an open mind and fresh perspective.

        I have always been curious about how things work and from a very young age until now I've love taking things
        apart and putting them back together. I have strong programming skills, with expertise in HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. I am always looking for new challenges to enhance my skills and stay current with the latest trends
        and
        technologies in the industry.

        One of my greatest strengths is my ability to work well with others. I believe that collaboration and
        communication are
        key to achieving project goals, and I always strive to build strong relationships with clients and colleagues.

        In addition to my career as a developer, I also have a passion for music. My wife May and I play in a band
        together, and
        we recently released our first album. Music inspires my creative side and fuels my passion for exploring new
        ideas and
        possibilities.

        Overall, I am a dedicated and talented software developer with a diverse skill set and a passion for learning
        and
        growth. If you're looking for a skilled and collaborative developer who can bring a unique perspective to your
        team,
        look no further than Francisco Orona. </h2>
